[wallpaper source](http://alex-tooth.deviantart.com/art/Follow-the-wind-513407376) - taken from [this setup](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/4inmkn/xfce_its_nothing_special_but_its_mine/)

*OS:* Arch Linux
*Window Manager:* bspwm
*Panel:* lemonbar-xft with Ruby script
*Terminal:* URxvt
*Shell:* zsh with grml config
*GTK theme:* Arc
*Icon theme:* Paper

## Installation
I haven't set this up properly yet so you'll have to install everything in depends.txt (which uses Arch package names so if you use anything else you'll have to search for equivalents and/or compile/fetch stuff yourself), then symlink everything, I guess.

## To-do list
* [ ] Panel
	* [ ] Volume block (or not)
	* [ ] Clickable areas
	* [ ] Refactor/cleanup
* [ ] Keybinds
	* [ ] Screenshot selection
	* [ ] Do something with the NYI function keys
	* [ ] Panel toggle
	* [ ] Gaps toggle
* [ ] Misc
	* [ ] A lock screen
	* [ ] Actually theme Rofi
* [ ] Probably impossible
	* [ ] IBus Hangul indicator in panel
* [ ] 
I'll find more stuff to rice later...

## Thanks to...
 * [Cheese(치주군)/unstabler](https://github.com/unstabler) for the base of the zsh theme, which I have barely made any changes to so far therefore it is not included
 * [Nathan](https://github.com/neeasade) for his bspwm setup which inspired me to actually make this
